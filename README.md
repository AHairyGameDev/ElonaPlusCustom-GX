# Elona+ Custom-GX 2.05

*\~Believe in Jure and hold a determination to mince.\~*

Elona+ Custom-GX is a new variant of Elona+ based on Elona+ Custom-G, to be updated with the changes in Elona+ up to version 2.05.

**NOTE**: Development is still in progress!

## Building

1. Download Elona+ 1.90, Elona+ Custom 1.90.2 and Elona+ Custom-G 1.90.2.4 from [here](https://elona.fandom.com/f/p/3340109923483964385).
2. Extract `elonaplus1.90` somewhere. Extract Elona+ Custom over the existing files, then do the same for Elona+ Custom-G. Copy the files in the install to the folder `assets/2.05-custom-gx` in this repository.
3. Download the HSP3.4 SDK (`hsp34a.zip`) from [here](http://hsp.tv/make/downlist.html) and extract it somewhere.
4. Open `main.hsp` with `hsed3.exe` from the HSP3.4 SDK folder. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to compile and run under debug mode.
5. Press <kbd>Ctrl+F9</kbd> to create the executable, `elonacgx.exe`.
6. Copy `elonacgx.exe` to your Elona+ Custom-G install from earlier and run it.

**Warning**: If you make any changes to the code, *always make sure the file encoding is set to SHIFT_JIS!* Otherwise, you'll get a lot of cryptic compiler errors.
